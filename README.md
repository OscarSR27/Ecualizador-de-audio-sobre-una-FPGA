# Description

Implementation of an audio equalizer based on digital signal processing theory. The implementation was carried out using the Verilog hardware description language, 
the Spartan 6 XC6SLX16-CSG324C FPGA, and the Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7 program. The system receive analog audio signals to process it in a basic DSP circuit. 
This circuit separates the audio into bass, mid, and treble tones in such a way that the user can choose which tones they wish to hear.
